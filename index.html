        <li>Correlation is used to describe the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient, r,
               describes the strength of the relationship. R can be any value between -1 and 1. r=1 indicates a
               strong positive correlation, meaning the data is very close together and the line of best fit of the data set 
               has a positive slope. r=-1 indicates a strong negative correlation, meaning the data is very close together
               and the line of best fit of the data set has a negative slope. The closer the correlation is to 0, the weaker
               the relationshiop is.</li>
