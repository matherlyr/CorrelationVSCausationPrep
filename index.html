        <li>Correlation is used to describe the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient, r,
               describes the strength of the relationship. R can be any value between -1 and 1. r=1 indicates a
               strong positive correlation, meaning the data is very close together and the line of best fit of the data set 
               has a positive slope. r=-1 indicates a strong negative correlation, meaning the data is very close together
               and the line of best fit of the data set has a negative slope. The closer the correlation is to 0, the weaker
               the relationshiop is.</li>
        <li>The difference between correlation and causation is that correlation describes how two variables are related, while 
               causation describes how one variable is the result of the other variable.</li>
        <li>Ways to visually show relationships:
              <ul>
                  <li> Locally Weighted Scatter Plot Smoothing (LOWESS): This way of displaying data better represents
                       the trends shown by the data than a line of best fit because this type of plot shows the curvature
                       of the data. This plot, however, can cause some confusion if the data is not color coded into categories.</li>
                  <li> Parallel Coordinates Plot: This way of displaying data is able to show relationships between
                       different types of data, such as categorical and quantitative data. Problems with this graph 
                       can occur when the order of variables is not sensible.</li>
                  <li> Regression: This way of displaying data allows you to predict how likely values are to occur when 
                        an explanatory variable to response variable. These prediction can not be extended to a larger group
                        than the group from which the data came from.</li>
